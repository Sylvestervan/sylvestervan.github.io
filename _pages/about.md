Welcome to My HomePage
======
This is Jindong Fan (English name: Sylvester Van). Currently majoring DPT (DataProcessingTechnology) in Dalian Neusoft University of Infomation.

I have been dedicating Computer Sciences for {since_my_education} years. Recent studies are leading me sculpted by difficulties & unlimited ideas via Algorithms. And I deeply consist what I have believed in is that:

$$
\displaylines{
\text{Convergence: } \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \|X_{\text{opt}} - X\| < \varepsilon \quad (X_{\text{opt}} = \text{Optimal}) \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \varepsilon} > 0 \quad \text{(Threshold growth)} \\
\eta_e = k/\varepsilon \quad (k > 0, \text{ Energy scaling}) \\
\tau \in \Omega\left(\log\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\right) \quad \text{(Time lower bound)} \\
P_{\text{success}} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon) \quad \text{(Probabilistic guarantee)}
}
$$
